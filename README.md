# ADS503-Healthcare-Analytics-Predicting-Length-of-Stay
Used R to predict length of stay at a hospital using Random Forests, Na√Øve Bayes, Flexible Discriminant Analysis, Multiple Discriminant Analysis, KNN, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machines, CART, C5.0, and Neural Networks.
Mistakes were made in this project due to being new to learning data preprocessing methods. Next time, we would change the categorical features into dummy variables.
